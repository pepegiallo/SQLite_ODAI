# Object orientated Data Access Transformer Interface
## for SQLite3

This interface makes it possible to store data in an object structure in an SQLite database. Custom data types allow the use of all possible Python elements that can be converted into a bytes array. Conversion methods when reading and writing data to an attribute allow for great dynamics in managing the data. Different objects can be linked to each other using references.
